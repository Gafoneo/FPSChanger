# FPSChanger (Lethal Company)

This mod cycles through fps values in your config when you press F6 (by default, can be changed in keybind settings). Note that only values that are present in-game can be chosen (subject to change in the future).

## Setup
1. Open the config file.
2. Enter your own comma-separated FPS values (default config: `30,250`). Note that 0 is for Vsync and 250 is for Uncapped.
3. The mod will cycle through them in-game when you press F6 (by default).
